### Game Story:

The current template lacks a detailed game story, so we thought of something to add to the atmosphere of the game.
There has been a Zombie Apocalypse, and humanity has to fight back to survive in the outside world. 
For this, dedicated training centers have been established by the authorities to help humans survive in the outside world, 
The level that we have implemented can be seen as a tutorial level, or a “combat simulation area” in the terms of the game’s story. 
Here, the players will be taught all the basic controls and gameplay mechanics to enjoy the game. 
The player can test various weapons against the robots to simulate fighting against the zombies in a hostile environment, choosing different difficulty settings as their skills improve.
